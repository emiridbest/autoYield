AutoYield

AutoYield is a decentralized savings dApp designed to maximize savings through three core features:

    ERC4626 Yield Vault: Utilizes an advanced yield optimization strategy with the ERC4626 standard for efficient asset management and yield generation.

    Auto Saver: Implements Chainlink Keeper functions to automate savings processes, ensuring regular and timely savings without manual intervention.

    Simple Saver: Allows users to lock up funds for a specified period, providing a straightforward way to save and earn interest.

Deployment

AutoYield is deployed on the BSC Testnet, providing a reliable environment for testing and interaction. It is primarily designed to function seamlessly with Opera Mini's Minipay mobile wallet, enhancing accessibility and user convenience.
Asset Categories

    BNB USD Stable: Can be deposited into the Yield Vault, Simple Saver, and Auto Saver. This asset provides stability and flexibility for users.

    BNB Native Coin: Features a dollar-cost-averaging model of savings, utilizing the Pyth Oracle to monitor the BNB/USD price pair. The system checks for a negative trend greater than 5% before permitting deposits, helping to hedge against the devaluation risk associated with native assets compared to stablecoins.
